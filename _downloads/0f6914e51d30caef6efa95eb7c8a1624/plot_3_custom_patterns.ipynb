        "\n# Advanced ONNX models quantization\n\nAkida, like any specialized hardware accelerator, sacrifices very generalized computational\nability in favor of highly optimized implementations of a subset of key operations. While\nwe strive to make sure that Akida directly supports the most important models, it isn't\nfeasible to support all possibilities. You may thus occasionally find yourself with a\nmodel which is very nearly compatible with Akida, but which fails to convert due to just\na few incompatibilities. In this example, we will look at some simple workarounds and how\nto implement them. The goal is to successfully convert the model to Akida without having\nto retrain.\n\nPreparing a model for Akida requires two steps: quantization, followed by conversion\nfor a specific target hardware device. We try to catch as many incompatibilities as\npossible at the quantization step. However, some constraints depend on the specific\ntarget device, and can only be caught at the conversion step. To illustrate, we will\nsimply walk through the process of preparing [ResNet50](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/validated/vision/classification/resnet#model)_ for\nacceleration on Akida - we'll run into several incompatibilities at different points\nin that process, and see how to resolve them.\n\nThis example assumes a moderate level of experience with deep learning, and good familiarity\nwith the operations typically encountered in these types of models. For example, here we'll\nuse the following workarounds:\n\n* to avoid some incompatible sequences of operations we'll insert layers with \"identity\"\n  convolution kernels,\n* in order to avoid an unusual kernel-size 1/stride 2 convolution, we'll substitute those\n  kernels with equivalent size 3 kernels.\n"

For example, ReLU activation functions, where present,\nare almost always applied on the outputs of the hard-working computational\nlayers (Convolutions, Depthwise Convolutions, Dense layers etc.). So the ReLU\non Akida is tied to those operations. While efficient, this does mean that\nsome sequences of operations will not by default be considered Akida-compatible,\neven though the individual operations are known to be handled. That's the\ncause of the problem encountered here.\n\n\nTo properly see what's going on, and to resolve the problem, we'll need to\nunderstand the concept of \"patterns\". These are the objects that QuantizeML\nuses to map ONNX models to their Akida equivalents. A pattern is a sequence of\ncontinuous [ONNX operators](https://onnx.ai/onnx/operators/) in a graph that\n**can be converted** to an\n[Akida V2 layer](../../api_reference/akida_apis.html#akida-v2-layers).\nFor example, the following model would be converted to an [akida.InputConv2D](../../api_reference/akida_apis.html#akida.InputConv2D) layer:\n\n.. figure:: ../../img/onnx_input_conv2d.png\n   :target: ../../_images/onnx_input_conv2d.png\n   :alt: InputConv2D example model\n   :scale: 80 %\n   :align: center\n\n   One ONNX configuration that would map to an [InputConv2D](../../api_reference/akida_apis.html#akida.InputConv2D).\n\n\nThe sequence of operators [``Conv``, ``Clip``, ``MaxPool``] **is one valid pattern**\nfor conversion towards [InputConv2D](../../api_reference/akida_apis.html#akida.InputConv2D).\n\n\nCrucially, we can check the list of the currently supported patterns:\n\n\n"

We can implement this workaround by using custom quantization\npatterns to extend ``PATTERNS_MAP``.\n\nEvery pattern includes an ONNX layer that stores the ONNX graph information for the matching\nsequence of nodes. QuantizeML also allows for a function to create a compatible layer from\nan initially incompatible pattern.

In this case, we'll have to\ntry simply modifying the padding to be Akida-compatible. Because this is the input\nlayer, we could actually negate that change by padding the input image along two\nedges before passing to Akida. However, precisely because this is the very start of\nthe network, and the consequence is only a single pixel of spatial offset, we might\nexpect that the impact on model performance will be negligible, and that's precisely\nwhat we find on testing.
