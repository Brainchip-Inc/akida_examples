        "## 1. Introduction: why spatiotemporal models?\n\nRecognizing gestures from video is a challenging task that requires understanding not just\nindividual frames but how those frames evolve over time. Traditional 2D convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) are limited here \u2014 they analyze only spatial features and discard temporal\ncontinuity. 3D CNNs, while well suited to the task, are on the other hand computationally heavy.\n\nTo tackle this, we turn to lightweight spatiotemporal models, specifically designed to process\npatterns in both space (image structure) and time (motion, rhythm). These models are essential\nfor tasks like:\n\n* Gesture classification\n* Online eye-tracking\n* Real-time activity detection in video streams\n\nAt the heart of these models lies a simple idea: decoupling spatial and temporal analysis,\nenables efficient, real-time detection \u2014 even on resource-constrained devices.\n\n"

Temporal convolution, which focuses on changes over time for each spatial pixel (e.g. motion).\n2. Spatial convolution, which looks at image structure in each frame (e.g. shape, position).\n\nThe figures below highlights the difference between a full 3D convolution kernel versus our\nspatiotemporal convolution (a.k.a.

Making it efficient using depthwise separable convolutions\n\nTo further reduce the computational load of the blocks, we can make them separable, just like\ndepthwise separable convolutions replace full convolutions, reducing computation with minimal\naccuracy loss, our decomposed temporal-spatial convolutions can also be made separable using\nan approach inspired by the [MobileNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)_. Each layer\nfrom the spatiotemporal block is decomposed into 2: the temporal convolution is\ntransformed into a depthwise temporal convolutional layer followed by a pointwise convolutional\nlayer (see figure above), the same is done for the spatial convolution.\n\n.. Note::\n  The design of these spatiotemporal blocks is similar to R(2+1)D blocks, except we place the\n  temporal layer first. Doing this preserves the temporal richness of the raw input \u2014 a critical\n  decision that avoids \"smearing\" out important movement cues. Moreover, notice that our temporal\n  layers do not have a stride (compared to R(2+1)D layers).\n\n.. figure:: ../../img/comparing_3D_conv_block_designs.png\n   :target: ../../_images/comparing_3D_conv_block_designs.png\n   :alt: various types of 3D convolutions\n   :scale: 60 %\n   :align: center\n\n   Kernel dimensions and strides for various types of 3D convolutions.

This is critical for streaming\n  inference where latency matters: we want to be able to make predictions immediately. Our\n  causal temporal layers don't rely on future frames and start making predictions after the\n  first frame is received.\n- **not using a temporal stride**: our model purposefully preserves time information and thus\n  is able to make a classification guess after each incoming frame.\n\nThese choices also allow us to configure the spatio-temporal layer in a efficient way using\nFIFO buffers during inference.\n\n"

        "### 6.1 FIFO buffering\n\nDuring inference, each temporal layer is replaced with a bufferized 2D convolution: i.e. a\nConv2D with an input buffer the size of its kernel (initialized with zeros), handling the\nstreaming input features. Spatial convolutions that have a temporal kernel size of 1 can be\nseamlessly transformed into 2D convolutions too.\n\n.. figure:: ../../img/fifo_buffer.png\n   :target: ../../_images/fifo_buffer.png\n   :alt: fifo_buffer\n   :scale: 80 %\n   :align: center\n\nAt its core, a convolution (whether 2D or 3D) involves sliding a small filter (also called\na kernel) over the input data and computing a dot product between the filter and a small\nsegment (or window) of the input at each step.\n\nTo make this process more efficient, we can use a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer to\nautomatically manage the sliding window. Here's how it works:\n\n- The input buffer holds the most recent values from the input signal (top row on the figure\n  above).\n- The size of this buffer is equal to the size of the temporal kernel.\n- After each new incoming values, we perform a dot product between the buffer contents and the\n  kernel to produce one output value.\n- Every time a new input value arrives, it's added to the buffer, and the oldest value is\n  removed.\n\nThis works seamlessly in causal convolutional networks, where the output at any time step only\ndepends on the current and past input values\u2014not future ones. Because of this causality, the\nbuffer never needs to \"wait\" for future input: it can compute the output as soon as the first\nframe comes in.\n\n**The result?**: Real-time gesture classification, running continuously, with predictions\nready after every frame.\n\n**How to?** : Akida models provides a simple and easy to use API that transforms compatible\nspatiotemporal blocks into their equivalent bufferized version found in\n[akida_models.tenn_spatiotemporal.convert_to_buffer](../../api_reference/akida_models_apis.html#akida_models.tenn_spatiotemporal.convert_to_buffer)_\n\n..
