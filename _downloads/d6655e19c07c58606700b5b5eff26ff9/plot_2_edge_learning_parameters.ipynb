Note:: The hints given in this tutorial are not a promise to get the best\n          performance. They can be seen as an initialization, before\n          fine-tuning.

        "## 3. Estimate the required number of weights of the trainable layer\n\nThe number of weights corresponds to the number of connections for each\nneuron. The smaller the number of weights, the less specific the neurons will\nbe. Setting this parameter correctly is important.\n\nAlthough the last trainable layer hasn't been created yet, we can already\nestimate the number of weights. This estimation is based on the statistics of\nthe output spikes from the feature extractor. Intuitively, a sample producing\nN spikes at the end of the feature extractor could be perfectly represented\nwith a neuron with N weights. We then use the median of the number of output\nspikes for all samples.\n\nTo reduce computing time, using only a subset of the whole dataset may be\nsufficient to get an estimation of the number of spikes. We then set the\nnumber of weights to a value sligthly higher than the median of the number of\nspikes: we generally choose 1.2 x median of number of spikes, which seems to\ngive good results.\n\nFor a deeper analysis of the output spikes from the feature extractor, one\ncould look at the distribution of the number of spikes, either for all samples\nor for samples of each class separately. This analysis is not shown here.\n\n"

        "## 4. Estimate the number of neurons per class\n\nUnlike a standard CNN network where each class is represented by a single\noutput neuron, an Akida native training requires several neurons for each\nclass to better represent the class variability. Choosing the right number of\nneurons per class is a trade-off between enough neurons to represent the\nclasses' variabilities, but not too many neurons implying more memory and\ncomputing time. This is similar to clustering algorithms where the clusters\nrepresent the distribution of the data. Note that, like clustering algorithms,\nthis analysis requires to have more samples per class than the number of\nneurons per class: only one neuron can learn per sample. Having more neurons\nthan samples, the extra neurons are guaranteed to be wasted.\n\nOne direct option is to train the classification layer using the whole dataset\nwith different values of number of neurons per class. Looking at the\nvalidation accuracy, it should increase with more neurons per class, then\nreach a plateau where adding more neurons has very small effect. Choosing the\nvalue where the accuracy begins to flatten is a good estimation.\n\nHowever, this method is very time consuming since it requires multiple\ntrainings using the whole dataset. Another option is to only train on a few\nnumber of classes. Rather than measuring accuracy, we measure the error\nbetween the potential of the matching neuron and the maximum theoretical\npotential. Taking a simple example:\n\n- Let's say 3 neurons per class, with 180 weights\n- A sample of a given class returns 3 potentials for the 3 neurons of its\n  class: [12, 153, 97]. The maximum potential is 153.\n- The error between the sample and the neuron is 180 - 153 = 27.\n- Compute the loss being the sum of the errors for all samples of a class.\n\nVisualizing the loss for a given class as a function of the number of neurons\ngives hints to have a first estimation of the number of neurons per class.\nVisualizing the number of neurons that have learned as a function of the\nnumber of neurons per class provides a similar analysis.\n\nIn this tutorial, we only present this analysis for one class (word 'six').\n\n"
