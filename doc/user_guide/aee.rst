The Akida Execution Engine
--------------------------

Performing basic tasks with the Akida Execution Engine is quite straightforward.
However, in fine tuning or for more complex tasks, an understanding of Spiking
Neural Networks, the Akida Neuron Model, and the parameters that define it, is
necessary.

Main steps to use the Akida Execution Engine:


#. `The Spiking Neural Network model <#id1>`_ – what layer types?
#. `Input data format <#id2>`_
#. `Determine training mode <#id3>`_
#. `Interpreting outputs <#id4>`_

1. The Spiking Neural Network model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All Akida Spiking Networks require an input layer and an additional layer. Other
layers may be required to optimize each Spiking Neural Network model, depending
on the given task. Currently, the Akida Execution Engine supports serial
feedforward architectures.

Three principal layer types are available:


* `FullyConnected <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__
  – sometimes described as ‘dense’
* `Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__
  – or ‘weight-sharing’
* `SeparableConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#separableconvolutional>`__

These three layer types may be combined as required: a typical model for
processing images like the MNIST dataset, might include the following series of layers:

.. code-block::

   InputData ➤ Convolutional ➤ Convolutional ➤ FullyConnected ➤ FullyConnected

2. Input data format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data format
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Akida Execution Engine processes spikes natively, so for many types of input
data, the User will need to select a method of conversion for the input signal
into an event-based representation, known as: data-to-spike conversion.
The Akida Execution Engine also has built-in data-to-spike converters that will
be available in the Akida NSoC. Currently, data-to-spike converters for
pixel-based and event-based data are available; while other converters will be
added in subsequent releases.

.. note::
    When sending (event-based) pre-generated spikes, the first Akida layer should
    be of type: `InputData <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputdata>`__.
.. note::
    The Akida integrated spike generator for image data (8-bit grayscale or RGB)
    is set up by defining the first layer as type:
    `InputConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputconvolutional>`__.
    This layer is configurable, either using trained-weights imported from a CNN
    or by setting its kernels through the Akida API.

Data frames parallelization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Akida Execution Engine can process several image data frames in parallel
through its `InputConvolutional
<../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputconvolutional>`__ layer. All
image frames should be grouped together inside a 4-dimensional array.

3. Determine training mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Akida NSoC supports for each layer loading pre-trained weights and
parameters. `Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__
and `FullyConnected <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__ layers
support online Akida unsupervised learning of new weights from pre-defined
parameters.

The choice between the two modes of operation for each layer depends first on
the input type for that layer: Akida unsupervised learning can only be performed
on input features in the form of binary events.

It also depends on the model architecture: Akida unsupervised learning is more
efficient on shallow models.

For deep models where online learning is required, it is therefore recommended
to import the weights of early layers from a pre-trained CNN, and to apply Akida
unsupervised learning only on the last layer.

Akida Unsupervised learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this mode, an Akida Layer will typically be compiled with specific learning
parameters, and then undergo a period of feed-forward training by letting it
learn from inputs generated by previous layers from a relevant dataset.

Please refer to `Using Akida Unsupervised Learning <aee.html#id5>`_ for details.

CNN to SNN conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `CNN2SNN toolkit <cnn2snn.html>`_ provides a means to convert a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) that was trained using Deep Learning methods to an Akida
``Model`` that can later be extended by adding additional Akida ``Layer`` types.

4. Interpreting outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that the Akida Execution Engine has an unsupervised learning mode.
Consequently, while it can learn to respond differently to different classes
of input, by definition it will never attach any meaning or “result” to its
outputs. Therefore, many tasks will require a classification stage. Either
simple labeling of neurons according to the classes that drive them best or,
highly sophisticated classification schemes. The Akida Execution Engine also
includes the possibility of (pseudo) supervised classification.
To summarize, if a training sample has an attached label, it is possible to
define a layer so that, during the training phase, neurons will only be allowed
to learn a representation when their target class is presented. During
inference, the output of the layer will then supply the class label directly.

Neural Network model
--------------------

Specifying the Neural Network model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Akida Neural Network models are defined using the sequential API. This comprises
creating a ``Model`` object and adding layers to it using the
`.add() <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#akida.Model.add>`__
method. The available layers are `InputData <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputdata>`__,
`InputConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputconvolutional>`__,
`FullyConnected <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__,
`Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__,
`SeparableConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#separableconvolutional>`__
and `Concat <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#concat>`__.
Layers are built with a name and a list of named parameters that are described
in the sections below.

Example of sequential definition of a model:

.. code-block:: python

   from akida import Model, InputData, FullyConnected, LearningType
   model = Model()
   model.add(InputData(name="input",
                       input_width=32,
                       input_height=32,
                       input_channels=1))
   model.add(FullyConnected(name="fully",
                            num_neurons=32,
                            threshold_fire=40))

Saving and loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``Model`` object can be saved to disk for future use with the
`.save() <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#akida.Model.save>`__
method that needs a path for the model. The model will be saved as a file,
typically .fb or .fbz (compressed), that describes its architecture and weights.
A saved model can be reloaded using the ``Model`` object constructor with the
full path of saved file as a string argument. This will automatically load the
weights associated to the model.

.. code-block:: python

   model.save("demo_CharacterDVS.fbz")
   loaded_model = Model("demo_CharacterDVS.fbz")

Input layer types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first layer of a neural network must be one of three possible input layer
types:


* `InputData <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputdata>`__ – universal
  input layer type. The User must apply their own event-generating
  transformation on the data – except where the data is already in an
  appropriate event-based format, e.g., the output from a neuromorphic camera.
* `InputConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputconvolutional>`__
  - image-specific input layer, taking either RGB or grayscale pixel input.

Data-Processing layer types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the input layer all subsequent layers will be data-processing layers.

As mentioned before, these layers do not process events in isolation, but rather
as groups of events – typically tens to hundreds of events together.

Each layer contains several neurons that are connected to the layer inputs
according to different topologies defined by the layer type. A weight is
assigned to each connection, and that weight is combined with the input
to modify the neuron potential.

When the neuron potentials have been evaluated, the layer feeds them to an
activation function that may or may not emit a spike.

A data-processing layer can be one of three types:


* `FullyConnected <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__ –
  each neuron is connected to members of the full set of possible inputs –
  hence ‘fully connected’, even though a much smaller number of connections
  are likely to be non-zero.
* `Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__ –
  each neuron’s connection weights express a localized filter – typically a
  region that is a small fraction of the input’s height and width. This filter
  is tested across all x and y positions.
* `SeparableConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#separableconvolutional>`__
  - a variant of the `Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__
  layer that is less computationally intensive due to simplified filters.

Both the `FullyConnected <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__
and `Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__
layer types can be trained using the Akida training algorithm.

Activation parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Akida activation function uses a quantization scheme to evaluate the neuron
response when its potential goes beyond its firing threshold.
The intensity of the response is measured by dividing the difference between the
potential and the threshold in several quantization intervals that correspond to
a set of quantized spike values. The default quantization scheme is ``binary`` :
whenever the neuron potential is above the threshold, a spike with a value of
one is emitted.

More generally, if we denote:


* T the threshold,
* s the length of a quantization interval,
* p the neuron potential,
* Q the quantized activation values.

``T + n * s < p <= T + (n + 1)*s => response = Q[n]``

All data-processing layers share the following activation parameters:


* ``threshold_fire``\ : integer value which defines the threshold for neurons to
  fire or generate an event. When using binary weights and activations, the
  activation level of neurons cannot exceed the ``num_weights`` value.
* ``threshold_fire_bits``\ : < one of ``[1, 2, 4]``\ > Defines the number of
  bits used to quantize the neuron response (defaults to one bit for binary).
  Quantized activations are integers in the range ``[1, 2^(weights_bits) -1]``.
* ``threshold_fire_step``\ : a float value, defining the length of the potential
  quantization intervals for threshold_fire_bits = 4. For 2 bits, this is 1/4 of
  the length of the potentials intervals and it is not relevant for 1 bit.

Pooling parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `InputConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputconvolutional>`__,
`Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__ and
`SeparableConvolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#separableconvolutional>`__
layer types share the following pooling parameters:


* [optional if ``pooling_type = Average``] ``pooling_width`` , ``pooling_height``:
  integer values, sets the width and height of the patch used to perform the
  pooling. If not specified it performs a global pooling.
* [optional] `pooling_type`: `PoolingType <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#poolingtype>`__
  Sets the effective pooling type (defaults to `NoPooling`):

  * ``NoPooling`` – no pooling.
  * ``Max`` – computing the maximum of each region.
  * ``Average`` – computing the average values of each region.

* [optional] ``pooling_stride_x``, ``pooling_stride_y``: integer values,
  set the horizontal and vertical strides applied when sliding the pooling
  patches. If not specified, a stride of ``pooling_width`` or ``pooling_height``
  is applied.

Using Akida Unsupervised Learning
---------------------------------

The Akida Unsupervised Learning is a unique feature of the Akida NSoC.

In this mode, an Akida Layer will typically be compiled with specific `learning
parameters <aee.html#id7>`__ and then undergo a period of feed-forward
unsupervised or semi-supervised training by letting it process inputs generated
by previous layers from a relevant dataset.

Once a layer has been compiled, new learning episodes can be resumed at any
time, even after the model has been saved and reloaded.

Learning constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only the last layer of a model can be trained with Akida Unsupervised Learning
and must fulfill the following constraints:

* must be of type `FullyConnected
<../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__ or `Convolutional
<../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__,

* must have binary weight,

* must receive binary inputs.

Compiling a layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a layer to learn using Akida Unsupervised Learning, it must first be
compiled with specific `learning parameters <aee.html#id7>`_ using the
`Model.compile <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#akida.Model.compile>`_ method.

The only mandatory parameter is the number of active (non-zero) connections that
each of the layer neurons has with the previous layer, expressed as the number
of active ``weights`` for each neuron.

Optimizing this value is key to achieving high accuracy in the Akida NSoC.
Broadly speaking, the number of weights should be related to the number of
events expected to compose the items’ or item’s sub-features of interest.

For example, in the MNIST dataset, sample images comprise a 28x28 pixel squares,
with substantial area of blank space, and a number of dark pixels composing the
characters. If only the x-y locations of the dark pixels were sent as events to
the neural network model, each sample would comprise of a few hundred events.

.. note::
    This case is only given as an example – there are better ways of encoding
    image data as events.

To train the MNIST dataset, using a very simple neural network model
configuration with a single `FullyConnected <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#fullyconnected>`__
type layer, it would be acceptable to set the number of weights per neuron in
that range (in this case perhaps: 300). If neurons have more weights than
required, they will acquire some ‘generalization’ that is: tolerance to slightly
different forms of the pattern they are intended to detect – but, will also lose
some ‘specificity’, or become more responsive to members of different classes.

The ``num_weights`` parameter has other dependencies, such as an
event-generating threshold or ``threshold_fire`` and the number of events
processed at a time, defined either by the size of an input image, the number
of input events, or the ``packet_size`` of an `InputData <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#inputdata>`__
layer.

Learning parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following learning parameters can be specified when compiling a layer:

* ``num_weights``: integer value which defines the number of connections for
  each neuron and is constant across neurons. When determining a value for
  ``num_weights`` note that the total number of available connections for a
  `Convolutional <../api_reference/aee_apis.html#convolutional>`__
  layer is not set by the dimensions of the input to the layer, but by the
  dimensions of the kernel. Total connections = ``kernel_height`` x
  ``kernel_width`` x ``num_features`` , where ``num_features`` is typically the
  ``num_neurons`` of the preceding layer. ``num_weights`` should be much smaller
  than this value – not more than half, and often much less.
* [optional] ``num_classes``: integer value, representing the number of
  classes in the dataset. Defining this value sets the learning to a ‘labeled’
  mode, when the layer is initialized. The neurons are divided into groups of
  equal size, one for each input data class. When an input packet is sent with a
  label included, only the neurons corresponding to that input class are allowed
  to learn.
* [optional] ``initial_plasticity``: floating point value, range 0–1 inclusive
  (defaults to 1). It defines the initial plasticity of each neuron’s
  connections or how easily the weights will change when learning occurs;
  similar in some ways to a learning rate. Typically, this can be set to 1,
  especially if the model is initialized with random weights. Plasticity can
  only decrease over time, never increase; if set to 0 learning will never occur
  in the model.
* [optional] ``min_plasticity``: floating point value, range 0–1 inclusive
  (defaults to 0.1). It defines the minimum level to which plasticity will decay.
* [optional] ``plasticity_decay``: floating point value, range 0–1 inclusive
  (defaults to 0.25). It defines the decay of plasticity with each learning
  step, relative to the ``initial_plasticity``.
* [optional] ``learning_competition``: floating point value, range 0–1 inclusive
  (defaults to 0). It controls competition between neurons. This is a rather
  subtle parameter since there is always substantial competition in learning
  between neurons. This parameter controls the competition from neurons that
  have already learned – when set to zero, a neuron that has already learned a
  given feature will not prevent other neurons from learning similar features.
  As ``learning_competition`` increases such neurons will exert more
  competition. This parameter can, however, have serious unintended consequences
  for learning stability; we recommend that it should be kept low, and probably
  never exceed 0.5.
